An independent Scotland would be welcome to join the European Union, a senior German lawmaker and ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel has said after Britain's vote to leave the bloc.
"The EU will still consist of 28 member states, as I expect a new independence referendum in Scotland, which will then be successful," said Gunther Krichbaum, a member of Merkel's conservatives and chairman of the European affairs committee in parliament.
"We should respond quickly to an application for admission from the EU-friendly country," he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Sunday that Scotland will do whatever it takes to remain in the EU, including potentially blocking legislation on a British exit from the bloc.
While Britain as a whole voted narrowly to leave the EU in last Thursday's referendum, Scotland voted by a 62 percent to 38 percent margin to remain. In a referendum in 2014 Scotland voted 55 percent to 45 percent to stay part of the United Kingdom, but polls show that support for independence has since risen.
Three chicks were born in the period from June 4 to 6.
Kaiyukan entrusted a research institute with DNA testing, which confirmed that the father of one of the three was a penguin of Tokyo Sea Life Park.
The fathers of the other two offspring, born through natural breeding, were being kept by Kaiyukan.
Kaiyukan has been jointly engaged in the artificial breeding of southern rockhopper penguins with Hiroshi Kusunoki, associate professor of breeding for conservation at the graduate school of Kobe University.
According to Kusunoki, other aquariums have also succeeded in artificially breeding other species of penguins.
An aquarium in San Diego succeeded in artificially breeding Magellanic penguins in 2013.
Kaikyokan, an aquarium in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture, successfully bred Humboldt penguins in an artificial manner in April 2016.
